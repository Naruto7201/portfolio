                <h6>Exploring Interest</h6>
                <p class="brief" id="research">
                    Since I am fascinated about the technologies and their working I am trying to explore the various
                    discipline of the Computer Science field. It is very large and can be considered as ocean of
                    knowledge.
                    I am learning coding at the moment alongwith web development(frontend, backend as well hosting) and
                    various other things.
